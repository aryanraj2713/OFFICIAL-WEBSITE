# ABOUT US

Enactus SRM is the social entrepreneurship club of SRM IST which aims towards uplifting rural communities and achieving United Nation's Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs) with the spirit of entrepreneurship, keeping in mind the motto --Nobody wins until we all win.

We have been constantly working with and for the betterment of local communities to create a better India. We believe that India's spirit lives in its villages. We have been working towards making the communities self-sustainable and independent by empowering them and enhancing their skills through several skill upliftment workshops and trainings.

We currently have three active projects including Project Prakrit, Project Jaladhi and Project FlyLife.
